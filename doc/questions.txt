The first click on the Show Add button in the CategoryTable
does not show the add section!?

Ivo:
The 1st time Show Add is clicked the text is not 'Show Add' but something like '\n             Show Add\n  '.
That's why it doesn't work as expected.

<button id="show-add" class="button" on-click="show">
  Show Add
</button>

->

<button id="show-add" class="button" on-click="show">Show Add</button>

CategoryTable component has categories
  @published Categories categories;
that are passed to it when the component is used:
  <template>
    <category-table categories="{{categories}}"></category-table>
  </template>

CategoryAdd component has categories
  @published Categories categories;
that are passed to it when the component is used:
  <template if="{{showAdd}}">
	<category-add
	  categories="{{categories}}">
	</category-add>
  </template>

Are the two categories the same object?
Yes (almost sure).

If a category is added to the second categories,
how to refresh the first categories?

The categories, when first used, must be observed.
In polymer_app.dart:
does not work: categories = toObservable(categoryLinksModel.categories);
what works:
categories = categoryLinksModel.categories;
categories.internalList = toObservable(categories.internalList);
// toObservable(categories.internalList); // does not work
In repeat="{{category in categories.internalList}}":
you cannot use categories.toList();
you must use categories.internalList.

category_edit.html
input field: value="{{category.description}}"
cannot change the value !?

Use a non-composite property:

@published String description;

  enteredView() {
    super.enteredView();
    description = category.description;
  }

html:  value="{{description}}

To try: add @published in front of description property in the model.

Tried, did not work:

@published
class Category extends ConceptEntity<Category> {
  @published String description;

value="{{category.description}}"

Tried in category_table.dart:
  enteredView()
    super.enteredView();
    categories.internalList = toObservable(categories.internalList);
  }
In polymer_app.dart:
//categories.internalList = toObservable(categories.internalList);
Category table is not refreshed after changes.

Can a Polymer component use CSS outside of the component?

===
When an entity is added or deleted from entities,
a table of entities is refreshed without entities.order().
For an updated entity,
entities.order() is used to refresh a table of entities
(which may be artificial for update on a non-sorting property).
How to force a polymer component to be refreshed without using entities.order()?

When there is only one entity in entities, entities.order() does not provoke
a refresh. This is a big problem!!!
When there is more than one entity, entities.order() does provoke
a refresh.
